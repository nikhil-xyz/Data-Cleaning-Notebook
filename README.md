# Data-Cleaning-Notebooks
This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various data cleaning techniques and best practices. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of data cleaning, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, data type conversion, or outlier detection. These notebooks utilize popular Python libraries like Pandas and provide practical examples for cleaning real-world datasets. The repository serves as a valuable resource for data scientists and analysts to learn and implement data cleaning workflows for improving data quality.

## **Data Cleaning**
Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting errors and inconsistencies in a dataset. It's a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning pipelines, as clean data leads to more accurate and reliable insights.

**Common Data Cleaning Tasks:**

- **Handling Missing Values:**
 - **Deletion:** Remove rows or columns with missing values.
 - **Imputation:** Fill missing values with estimated values (mean, median, mode, or more advanced techniques).
- **Detecting and Removing Outliers:**
 - Identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm.
 - Remove or correct outliers to improve data quality.
- **Correcting Inconsistent Data:**
 - Standardize data formats (e.g., date, currency).
 - Resolve inconsistencies in data types (e.g., numeric vs. text).
- **Removing Duplicates:**
 - Identify and remove duplicate records to avoid bias and redundancy.
- **Data Validation:**
 - Ensure data integrity by checking for logical errors and inconsistencies.
 - Validate data against predefined rules or constraints.
